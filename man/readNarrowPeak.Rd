\usage{
readNarrowPeak(paths, metadata)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{Character vector storing paths for BED files containing peak
calls for each sample, in the same order as in the Sample column of
\code{metadata}.}

\item{metadata}{A dataframe with at least two columns: "Sample" which stores
the sample identifiers, and "Condition" which stores
the biological condition labels of the samples.}
}
\value{
Named list of GRanges objects containing peak calls for each sample.
}
\description{
A helper function for reading in narrow peak calls for a set of samples.
Peak calls are assumed to be in ENCODE narrowPeak format
(\url{https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12}) as returned by
MACS2 (\url{http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/}). This is BED6+4 format.
}
\examples{

bedfiles <- system.file("extdata", paste0(samples, ".H3K4me3.bed"),
package = "chromswitch")

metadata <- data.frame(Sample = samples,
    H3K4me3 = bedfiles,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

readNarrowPeak(bedfiles, metadata)
}
